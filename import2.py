  In addition to pyhton's many built-in commands, there is an endless number
  of third party commands that can be brought into python and used in your 
  script. Before importing these at the beginning of your script, they must
  be installed. Python's installer is called pip.exe. I recommend keeping a file
  called 'dependencies.txt' where you list every third party install, so if you
  ever have to use another computer, you know exactly what to install to be 
  sure all of your code functions correctly.
